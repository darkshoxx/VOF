Weclome to Voice Only Frotz

Built from a modified version of dumb frotz.
`original_dumb` contains the files form the original tarball
`modified_dumb` has compiler-friendly modifications to compile with MingW64 using
`gcc -std=c89 -o dumb-frotz *.c`
creating the `dumb-frotz.exe` which lets you play z-files like zork directly
on the windows commandline. Tested with `cmd` and `PowerShell`.
